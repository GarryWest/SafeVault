# Here's a **summary of the vulnerabilities identified**, the **fixes applied**, and how Copilot **helped debug and resolve issues** throughout your setup.

## **🔍 Identified Vulnerabilities & Issues**

### **1️⃣ SQL Injection Risks**

🔹 Initially, we discussed how **raw SQL queries** could expose your app to injection attacks.  
🔹 **Potential Risk:** Malicious inputs could manipulate database queries and cause security breaches.

✅ **Fix Applied:**

- Used **LINQ to Entities**, which automatically **parameterizes queries** to prevent SQL injection.
- Avoided `FromSqlRaw()` without parameters.

### **2️⃣ Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Risks**

🔹 User input in form fields posed a potential **XSS attack vector**, allowing injected scripts.  
🔹 **Potential Risk:** Malicious scripts could execute in users' browsers.

✅ **Fix Applied:**

- **Sanitized user input** using `HtmlEncode()` to prevent direct script injection.
- Ensured Razor views **automatically encoded output**, avoiding `Html.Raw()`.

### **3️⃣ Issues with Identity UI Routing**

🔹 The scaffolded **Identity UI wasn’t redirecting correctly**, preventing login/registration pages from loading properly.  
🔹 **Potential Risk:** Users couldn’t authenticate, breaking core functionality.

✅ **Fix Applied:**

- Added `app.MapRazorPages();` to ensure Identity routes were properly mapped.
- Debugged `Register.cshtml.cs` to confirm expected redirection behavior.

### **4️⃣ InMemory Database & User Persistence Issues**

🔹 Using an **InMemory database caused user data to disappear** after restarting the app.  
🔹 **Potential Risk:** Authentication failed because seeded users were lost.

✅ **Fix Applied:**

- Implemented **automatic user seeding on each startup** in `Program.cs`.
- Recommended switching to a **persistent database** (SQLite or SQL Server) for real-world deployments.

### **5️⃣ Login Issues & Username vs. Email Confusion**

🔹 The scaffolded **Login UI prompted for email instead of username**, causing login failures.  
🔹 **Potential Risk:** Users couldn’t log in with their correct credentials.

✅ **Fix Applied:**

- Removed the `[EmailAddress]` annotation in `InputModel`.
- Changed field references from `Email` to `Username` in both the **model** and **view**.
